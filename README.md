Thought nobody uploaded this. Seems attendie. 
  
  C.F.M T/B and hosts, internet, frameworks.


  Currently looking at multiplier on one unit of loopback from high movement and middle point of high movement enters then/and percentage of deviation that covers it where ATR exits. Seems like bot uses all together, so it calculates by Stop loss and take profit multipliers while using the strategies.


  
  Bitcoin has no entries - it probably is very simple and easy.
  
  Since 2022
  
  Finding out maximum price exit.
  
  Finding out maximum drawdown.
  
  Finding out times it enters and exits.
  
  Finding out how many loses and wins. If collidable by win and minimal drawdown you good if the capital is low and loses small.
  
  Using minimal capital.
  
  Testing tightest and most wide parameters.
  
  If its below the value of sub-pair currency the tightest parameters will work. Depends how the currency works with it, most do not.
So if you get into ticks and forget mommentum caving in - you're ripping out a lot of coins.
If its beyond the value of the sub-pair currency the widest parameters will work. This is on most well-known standard pairs.
Scrip, scrap its just same standard unless its this movement.
Using multiplier as a drawer and if spread is just dropping quickly out its not all bullshit.
