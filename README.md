There may be an index barrier.
Thought nobody uploaded this. Seems attendie. 
  
  C.F.M T/B and hosts, internet, frameworks.


  Currently looking at multiplier on one unit of loopback from high movement and middle point of high movement enters then/and percentage of deviation that covers it where ATR exits. Seems like bot uses all together, so it calculates by Stop loss and take profit multipliers while using the strategies.


  
  Bitcoin has no entries - it probably is very simple and easy.
  
  Since 2022
  
  Finding out maximum price exit.
  
  Finding out maximum drawdown.
  
  Finding out times it enters and exits.

  Using minimal capital.
  
  Testing tightest and most wide parameters.

  Many things to count, but since it just moves on there is not much to count not knowing in comparisons.
  Trying to do so around and to predict... I once made this picture and drew an "X" with bars, skips, points. It was synthethic infinite, but the result was unclear - almost remembered... I must have identified an UFO... Anyway one of clouds or frameworks or procedure calls "must have" deleted it on other premises or my computer... I think.
  
  This bot is good at doing it as Ctrader compiler allows. Which as matter of fact has fake versions coming always and always.

  Finding out how many loses and wins. If collidable by win and minimal drawdown you good if the capital is low and loses small. Comparing do times match with loss amount or winning amount if they do you don't want to enter it and how close were these losses to one another (on the drawer) if you prefer and/or finding out maximum loss etc... Anyway the indicator follows price and do what it wants. Something cryptocurrency does not do usually the data is accessed through API.

  Usually you'd just build a "cookdown logic", because it is all scalping otherwise you get to wait on backend code or "market dropping/rising".
  
  If its below the value of sub-pair currency the tightest parameters will work. Depends how the currency works with it, most do not.
So if you get into ticks and forget mommentum caving in - you're ripping out a lot of coins.
If its beyond the value of the sub-pair currency the widest parameters will work. This is on most well-known standard pairs.
Scrip, scrap its just same standard unless its this movement.
Using multiplier as a drawer and if spread is just dropping quickly out its not all bullshit, because some cryptocurrencies below US dollar value already have timeframing of 30 minutes pointed out where if it changes its points (000.0000000 blablalba or wins them on firm) the indicator will show longer bars on lower currencies "virtually".

   "This is not why I used this cubic bot, makes it obvious and simple." - but i can type it? Its good on checking input/output/input/output. on timeframes, because nothing here is "abstract", except bitcoin.

   Blablablaa the leverage will increase your loss on low capital and (decrease value). Looking for a currency exchanged higher/major than its minor/sub-pair. You want the stop loss be consistent with bid you place anyhow. Higher bid, higher stop loss, but to decrease take profit if you bid high amount on high leverage if capital/money/funds allows - should (leave into profit in a tick?). In a minute.
    
  Just my own reminder.

  I had different story though -- Submitted some things somehow now the market is more regulated, but not sure about how INDEXES will absolutely virtually fail. ETORO.COM had huge problem, where developer built false leverage.
