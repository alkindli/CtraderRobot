  These are real samples, cannot submit anymore.

  Currently looking at multiplier on one unit of loopback from high movement and middle point of high movement enters then/and percentage of deviation that covers it where ATR exits. Seems like bot uses all together, so it calculates by Stop loss and take profit multipliers while using the strategies.


  
  Bitcoin has no entries - it probably is very simple and easy.
  
  Since 2022
  
  Finding out maximum price exit.
  
  Finding out maximum drawdown.
  
  Finding out times it enters and exits.

  Using minimal capital.
  
  Testing tightest and most wide parameters.

  Many things to count, but since it just moves on there is not much to count not knowing in comparisons.
  Trying to do so around and to predict... I once made this picture and drew an "X" with bars, skips, points. It was synthethic infinite, but the result was unclear - almost remembered... I must have identified an UFO... Anyway one of clouds or frameworks or procedure calls "must have" deleted it on other premises or my computer... I think.
  
  This bot is good at doing it as Ctrader compiler allows. Which as matter of fact has fake versions coming always and always.

  Finding out how many loses and wins. If collidable by win and minimal drawdown you good if the capital is low and loses small. Comparing do times match with loss amount or winning amount if they do you don't want to enter it and how close were these losses to one another (on the drawer) if you prefer and/or finding out maximum loss etc... Anyway the indicator follows price and do what it wants. Something cryptocurrency does not do usually the data is accessed through API.

  Usually you'd just build a "cookdown logic", because it is all scalping otherwise you get to wait on backend code or "market dropping/rising".
  
  If its below the value of sub-pair currency the tightest parameters will work. Depends how the currency works with it, most do not.
So if you get into ticks and forget mommentum caving in - you're ripping out a lot of coins.
If its beyond the value of the sub-pair currency the widest parameters will work. This is on most well-known standard pairs.
Scrip, scrap its just same standard unless its this movement.
Using multiplier as a drawer and if spread is just dropping quickly out its not all bullshit, because some cryptocurrencies below US dollar value already have timeframing of 30 minutes pointed out where if it changes its points (000.0000000 blablalba or wins them on firm) the indicator will show longer bars on lower currencies "virtually".

   "This is not why I used this cubic bot, makes it obvious and simple." - but i can type it? Its good on checking input/output/input/output. on timeframes, because nothing here is "abstract", except bitcoin.

   Blablablaa the leverage will increase your loss on low capital and (decrease value). Looking for a currency exchanged higher/major than its minor/sub-pair. You want the stop loss be consistent with bid you place anyhow. Higher bid, higher stop loss, but to decrease take profit if you bid high amount on high leverage if capital/money/funds allows - should (leave into profit in a tick?). In a minute.
    
  Just my own reminder.

  I had different story though -- Submitted some things somehow now the market is more regulated, but not sure about how INDEXES will absolutely virtually fail. ETORO.COM had huge problem, where developer built false leverage.

GBP is still in European unit that took majestic in disguise control over Europe. EUR is the laziest and most liquid exchanger ever. 5:57 AM Yes, you're on the right track! Here's a more detailed breakdown:

Margin Calculation in Forex Trading In a currency pair like USD/TRY, USD is the base currency and TRY is the quote currency. When you place a trade, you are effectively buying or selling the base currency using the quote currency.

The margin required for a trade is typically calculated based on the value of the base currency. For example, if you want to trade 1,000 units of USD/TRY, the margin required will be a percentage of the value of 1,000 USD in TRY.

When you buy USD/TRY, you are buying USD and selling TRY. Conversely, when you sell USD/TRY, you are selling USD and buying TRY.

Example Calculation Let's say the exchange rate for USD/TRY is 34. If you want to buy 1,000 USD:

The value of 1,000 USD in TRY is ( 1,000 \times 34 = 34,000 ) TRY.

If your broker requires a 2% margin, the margin required would be ( 34,000 \times 0.02 = 680 ) TRY.

Key Points The amount of money required to open a position, calculated based on the value of the base currency.

Allows you to control a larger position with a smaller amount of money. For example, with 50:1 leverage, you can control $50,000 with $1,000. The bid price is what you can sell the base currency for, and the ask price is what you can buy the base currency for.

Market. 114 All worked have static values now. 2:00 PM CHFCAD still makes it 0.20 as exchange rate is 1.60 which is not value and looking at all makes it one way but bought a bit DKK and JPY of course by paying 2:11 PM Seems like, because of telemetrics by blackbull or whole planet are selling and buying USDTRY for 2 dollars. Weird USDTRY has telemetrics at it's exchange rate as value and the volumetrics are not cutting out while USDHKD has quite same volumetrics, but telemetrics are half off as value with exchange rate for same 2 dollars. 2:53 PM CHFCAD still just makes it 0.20 value at average point exchange rate 4 and if we look at all bought JPY, DKK of course by paying meanwhile everyone else invested in CHF and it's going for a fall nothing politically in calendar, but SGD has somethings prepared CHF like a autumn yes so it's going to buy TRY or SGD. Nope CHF buys to pay too much to it's neighbors and even Mexicans and GBP, USD, CAD kill values. 4:40 AM Best website for economic calendar that has CHN, TRY, HKD, SGD with importance and consensus, previous and forecast. 5:14 AM So in reverse vice versa the more paid JPY the higher currency the others paid for the better for that higher currency to pay JPY 8:38 AM Currently ZAR has been paid 2.30% from every currency including major almost except JPY JPY has bought 2.00% from major currencies. Their values differ so much for what's on news. 13th October. 2024 9:44 AM USDCAD USDTRY USDZAR

EURUSD, GBPUSD 9:57 AM Now let's count volumetric from NZDUSD nominal telemetrics 1.1000 to influencing telemetrics of GBPUSD 0.6000 to influencing telemetrics AUDUSD 0.3400 to influencing telemetrics EURUSD ending in an error volumetric by influence 0.7 to 0.9 is 0.2 to 0.1 current forcing USDCAD nominal all 1.3 for any further currency. Current needed ZARJPY 10:07 AM 13th October USD is average state value 3.2 in market 10:16 AM JPY "likes" all exotic pairs 4:50 PM When market has no news we just follow statistics, values, volume, telemetric. The bigger currency is paying more to buy smaller. So best forex investment is USDCAD. 4:58 PM Oh forgot is less in exchange to more from less. Mistaken SGD, HKD, TRY, CHN for high. 2:45 AM So we look how much same base currency buys which quota currencies not really by value, so JPY is a lot more if GBP buys it by fall in GBPJPY, making GBP much stronger. Saying that if your pair is out of combat of USD, GBP, CAD, -EUR when they are falling/buying, paying or rising/paying, buying as base currencies other currencies which is a bid for our pair if not enough base currencies bought, paid the quota currency by falling then by highest valuable different base currency you are good to bid. If it's rising/paying, buying you are good to ask, but the quota currency with out of combat base currency if quota currency has been falling/buying, paying enough valuable other currencies as base currency. Example JPY does not have much base, but still does. Economic calendar does not have to point out both pairs against each other, but has to match or we can just do that if economic calendar shows nothing that's sentiment 4:40 AM The lowest point USDCAD was 1.0000. The highest point NOKSEK was 1.3000. The highest point AUDJPY 110.0000. The lowest point GBPSEK 10.0000. Lowest fall to zero and highest reach 100% gain. Only reason. Drops out in order. Other do not matter. 6:49 AM So if most valuable known GBP falls it should buy, pay fall for lowest valuable currencies. No swapping. The telemetric should release from between values in exchange rate to the most open in telemetric. The volumes do not matter it's all 0-100%. Like I've know it's up and news show down you sell it. Never did. 7:01 AM Then there's programmatic RGB being in gravitationalized timezone. Not sentimental. Neither 1:2 - > - 2:1? Liquid and open.

So basically long term crossed the short term which changes the price as moving average is used historians where the speed is measured from current world inhabitance measuring which is not used by historians at overlaps then if it's strongly stunting any direction where high trend direction in momentum identifies will it be loss or win for the next day which is also used by historians and in the end you look at the history of all wins rises together for average and if it crosses the point for loss or win then it will be that loss or win which is also not used in overlaps by historians. Forget what sentiment that was or any please and don't put it in market calendar especially for GBP like continents, please, please. Super.

I can't find average point, because yours ctrader shows wrong values for selling and buying forex in volumes I guess, so. When I want to buy or sell USDTRY it shows 2.00$ value for 1000 volume even though USD buying TRY should be around 6$ if we don't take the heartbeats or minimals after 0.~? Or is the margin value in dollars that I buy or sell USDTRY the average point of both values? Because 1 USD is 34 Liras so is 1 EUR around 34 Liras. I don't think market should be globalized, because of this and in this manner, and taking child percussions, and bank digital cards in families, continentally, inside markets, countries, but the percussion issue is in illegal conducts published online, because of high knowledge can also be due to closed code heritage or open code, open source. Now let me explain why market should be globalized and directed.

These are the overlaps of programming and have nothing to do with reality counting onwards, virtualizing wrongly backwards. Everything to do with volume and value in Ctrader.

Am just saying that the price is locked by ctrader for Blackpool which has nothing to do with real world this is impacting all the methods and math we know about trading forex and thus pairs have nothing to do with average point of value in exchange. SEKJPY for another example is 0.19 either you buy it or sell it and 1 SEK value is around 14 Japanese yens, so yes one way it is around 0.19$. EURSEK either you buy it or sell it and 1 EUR value is around 11 Swedish Kronas, but for 1000 volume it sells or buys for 2.19$. Is this, because of both currency values? Which are the currency pairs where either currency primarily take privilege over the secondary currency? For example USD is primarily and CAD is secondary so it's USD always buying CAD which makes it USDCAD, but it's up to me to sell, bid or ask, buy it, correct? So by pairs in forex which are the pairs that have highest privilege over the other, secondary in the manner I mentioned? This must be one way, though just like stocks exist. So it's the volume for balance, virtualization and standard while correcting the value.

By the way it's not called margin to margin. By the way you can manipulate on submission virtually, you can deepen it or act as shallow when you go outside with your friends. By the way leaks don't happen if you don't put them there on submissions or input.

During anytime anyone past had to do it and can do it if they set their mind to it and can stand couple of months on CHATGPT.
Even if it seems charted you are doing you.

So whoever trades on the market does not govern or manage it or change the value, it is that real. Unless you are a bookeeper especially on sports that is different.
