# cTrader Bot Project (Phases 333 to 360)

## Overview
This project contains the complete implementation of a cTrader bot, covering phases 333 to 360. The bot includes advanced signal logic, reinforcement learning integration, adaptive SL/TP tuning, CAB logging, MetaVvAI feedback, and more.

## Phases Description
### Phase 333: TripleConfirmationSignal Logic
- Combines Envelope, Engulfing, and Boilinger signals.

### Phase 334: Weighted Scoring System
- Assigns confidence scores to signals.

### Phase 335: CAB Logging + Chart Markers
- Logs trades and adds chart markers.

### Phase 336: MetaVvAI RL Feedback
- Injects RL reward signals based on trade outcomes.

### Phase 337: Reward Decay + Normalization
- Applies time-based decay to rewards.

### Phase 338: Session Overlays
- Visual summaries of trading sessions.

### Phase 339: CAB-MetaVvAI Sync
- Syncs CAB logs with RL state and predictive loops.

### Phase 340: Reward Confidence Bands
- Adds overlays and decay logic.

### Phase 341: CAB Timeline Overlays
- Feedback loops for signal reinforcement.

### Phase 342: Adaptive SL/TP with CAB Overlays
- Adjusts SL/TP based on confidence score and visual overlays.

### Phase 343: CAB + MetaVvAI Fusion Logic
- Fusion of CABReplay overlays with MetaVvAI RL feedback.

### Phase 344: Predictive Overlays
- Adds predictive overlays for future RL confidence.

### Phase 345: RL Scoring Heatmaps
- Visual heatmaps for RL scoring.

### Phase 346: CAB-MetaVvAI Signal Fusion
- Fusion of CAB and MetaVvAI signals.

### Phase 347: Adaptive Lot Sizing
- Adjusts lot sizing based on signal strength.

### Phase 348: Session-Aware SL/TP Tuning
- Session-aware SL/TP adjustments.

### Phase 349: Export-Ready Packaging
- Final export packaging.

### Phase 350: Final Integration and Testing
- Comprehensive testing and integration.

### Phase 351: Advanced Telemetry Integration
- Integrates advanced telemetry for monitoring.

### Phase 352: Live Deployment Hooks
- Adds hooks for live deployment.

### Phase 353: AI Signal Blending
- Blends AI signals for enhanced decision making.

### Phase 354: Error Recovery Mechanisms
- Implements error recovery mechanisms.

### Phase 355: Performance Logging
- Logs performance metrics.

### Phase 356: Final Export Packaging
- Final export packaging.

### Phase 357: Comprehensive Testing
- Comprehensive testing of all phases.

### Phase 358: Documentation Generation
- Generates documentation for the project.

### Phase 359: User Interface Enhancements
- Enhances the user interface.

### Phase 360: Final Integration and Deployment
- Final integration and deployment.
